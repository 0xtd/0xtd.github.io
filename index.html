    <p><b>Thiruvananthapuram</b>: In view of the rising online frauds, city cyber police have<br>urged the people to be extra cautious and have also shared tips to stay safe while<br> doing online transactions.</p>
    <p>Interestingly, most people who are getting duped in such frauds are educated<br>and also possess a fair technical knowledge, said the cyber police in a press<br>release. In most cases the greed to make easy money lands people in such frauds.<br>A total of nearly Rs 10 crore is lost per month on online frauds in the state, said the<br>police.</p>
    <p>Lack of knowledge about online banking and the need to keep passwords and<br>other details secure, negligence in using devices cautiously and sharing personal<br>details via social media allow cyber criminals to follow and steal personal details of<br>the users.</p>
    <p>The police said there is a tendency among people to share personal details in the<br>links and mobile numbers shared by unknown people on OLX, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Instagram" target="_blank">Instagram</a>,<br>Facebook, Whatsapp etc.</p>
    <p>Providing personal details in online job and marriage portals without<br>understanding the authenticity is also dangerous.</p>
    <p>The people must be very alert while doing financial transactions online and also<br>the authenticity of the website on which the transactions are done.</p>
    <p>Public should not share OTP and other personal details with others. People who<br>got cheated must register complaints at the toll-free number 1930 and also on<br><a href="https://www.cybercrime.gov.in/" title="_blank">www.cybercrime.gov.in</a> immediately, the police said.</p>
